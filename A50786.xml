            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that famous Antiquary, tells us, that ſeveral of the Patriarchs were ſtudious herein: Long after that, it was practiſed by the <hi>Chaldeans, Aegyptians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> who by their continual ſtudy for many hundred years, did arrive to a great height of knowledge herein, being encouraged thereunto by their Kings and Princes, who themſelves would undertake no great Enterprize, but would firſt conſult with an Aſtrologer, and accounted them
<pb facs="tcp:61484:151"/>
the moſt fit men for the managing of State-affairs. And after them it was practiſed by the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> who have found out many excellent Rules which conduced to the great perfections of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; and there are yet many excellent things to be found, which are not diſcovered. We want the encouragement which the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> had, which is the reaſon that Aſtrologie is so much deſpiſed, and ſo ſlightly looked upon; for that is the madneſs of many, to ſpeak ill of what they know not; they paſs their malicious cenſures upon the Art, before they know what it is: For Knowledge and Learning was always the moſt deſpiſed by the Ignorant; as the Fox in the Fable diſpraiſed the figs, becauſe he could not reach to them. In the following Treatiſe I have endeavored to make the Art as plain and eaſie as I could poſsibly do: In the firſt Part, I have ſhewed how the Student ought to proceed herein; and firſt he ought to be well acquainted with the
<pb facs="tcp:61484:151"/>
Characters of the Signes, Planets and Aſpects, and of their natural and accidental ſignifications; alſo to underſtand the Eſſential and accidental Fortitudes, and Debilities of the Planets, the natural ſignification of the 12 Houſes in an Aſtrological figure, and how to vary the houſes according to the Queſtion propounded.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Part, I have collected and publiſhed the choice and principal Rules which conduce to the true judging of Horary Queſtions, and have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing which might be helpful to the Student herein. Alſo I have given Examples in all or moſt of the Houſes, by inſerting Figures for ſeveral Horary Queſtions, and ſhewed how to give Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereupon; which will be a great advantage to the Learners, for whoſe profit I have undertaken the pains of compoſing this Treatiſe; wherein if I finde encouragement, I inſtead, by Gods aſſiſtance, to publiſh ſeveral things of this nature. There has been ſomething publiſhed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologie
<pb facs="tcp:61484:152"/>
ſince this was begun, and which, I living remote from <hi>London,</hi> had not the opportunity to ſee; but having lately peruſed them, with all reſpect to thoſe Artiſts, I finde no reaſon to deſiſt from the publication of this, hoping as to the ſcope intended, it may, (though leſs of price) be altogether as uſeful as <hi>Coley's Clavis, Thaſher's Jubar,</hi> or any other of our modern Treatiſes; I having endeavoured more plainneſs to weak capacities than any that yet have written. And if this ſmall Treatiſe receive your kinde accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it ſhall be but a taſte of what you may hereafter expect from</p>

               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Conjunction</hi> is when two Planets are in one and the ſame degree and minute of a Signe; and this is either good or bad as the Planets are either Friends or Enemies one to the other.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Sextile</hi> Aſpect is when two Planets are two ſignes or 60 degrees diſtant, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 15 degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> in 15 degrees of <hi>Gemini.</hi> Here <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> is in a <hi>Sextile</hi> Aſpect to <hi>Saturn;</hi> this is an Aſpect of Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Quadrate</hi> Aſpect is when two Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are three ſignes or 90 degrees diſtant; as <hi>Mars</hi> in 10 degrees of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in 10 degrees of <hi>Leo.</hi> Here <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are ſaid to be in <hi>Quadrate</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which by Artiſts is accounted an Aſpect of imperfect enmity; and that the perſons ſignified thereby may at ſome times have jarrs, but ſuch as may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled again.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61484:9"/>
               <p>A <hi>Trine</hi> Aſpect is when any two Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are four ſignes or 120 degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; as <hi>Mars</hi> in 12 degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Sol</hi> in 12 degrees of <hi>Leo.</hi> Here <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are ſaid to be in <hi>Trine</hi> Aſpect; and this is an Aſpect of perfect Love and Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Oppoſition</hi> is when two Planets are diametrically oppoſite; which is when they are ſix ſignes or 180 degrees (which is one half of the Circle) aſunder. And this is an Aſpect of perfect hatred.</p>
               <p>But although an Aſpect conſiſt of ſo many degrees as we have mentioned, yet Planets are ſaid to be in aſpect when they are not exactly in the ſame degrees, but within the moiety of their Orbs: for which, ſee hereafter Chapter the 6th: and this is called a Platick Aſpect. A Partile Aſpect is when two Planets are in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Aſpect to the very ſame degree and minute.</p>
               <p>Aſpects are alſo termed <hi>Dexter</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</hi> Thoſe Aſpects are called <hi>Dexter,</hi> which are contrary to the ſucceſſion of Signes; as a Planet in <hi>Aries</hi> caſts his <hi>Sextile</hi> dexter to <hi>Aquarius.

               <p>The eighth, ninth, and tenth Columns exhibit the degrees of the Ecliptick that are Deep or pitted, Lame or deficient, and thoſe degrees which Increaſe Fortune, as the Title directs. The Table is ſo eaſie, that it needs no further Explanation: The Uſe whereof followeth.</p>

               <p>If the degrees aſcending in a Nativity or Queſtion ſeriouſly propounded, be thoſe which are termed Light, the perſon ſignified thereby will be more clear and fair: If thoſe accounted Dark, or Smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, his complexion is more obſcure and cloudy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the degrees aſcending be thoſe which are termed Void, it ſhews that the perſon ſignified thereby is but of a mean under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and very defective in his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>When you finde any of thoſe degrees (aſcending, or the principal ſignificators poſited therein) which are termed Lame or deficient, it is an argument that the perſon ſignified thereby is defective in ſome part of the body, either Crooked, Lame, or Blind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Of the Houſes, Antiſcions, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Enmity, and of the Orbs and Latitude of the Seven Planets.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Seven Planets by experience are found to delight in ſome of the Twelve Signes more than in others, as being more agreable to their nature; and therefore they are termed their Houſes, becauſe they are more fortunately placed therein, than in the reſt of the Signes. Each of the Seven Planets, except <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> have two of the Signes allowed for their Houſes: As to <hi>Saturn, Capricorn</hi> and <hi>Aquarius;</hi> to <hi>Jupiter, Sagittary</hi> and <hi>Piſces;</hi> to <hi>Mars, Aries</hi> and <hi>Scorpio;</hi> to <hi>Sol, Leo;</hi> to <hi>Venus, Taurus</hi> and <hi>Libra;</hi> to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61484:33"/>
                  <hi>Mercury, Gemini</hi> and <hi>Virgo;</hi> to <hi>Luna, Cancer:</hi> and in theſe Signes they are the beſt fortified.</p>
               <p>But although all the Planets except the Luminaries have two Signes allowed them for their Houſes, yet they are found to take more delight in one of the Houſes than in the other; <hi>viz. Saturn</hi> delights moſt in <hi>Aquarius, Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Sagittary, Mars</hi> delights moſt in <hi>Scorpio, Venus</hi> delights moſt in <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> delights moſt in <hi>Virgo.</hi> The Artiſt ought chiefly to underſtand the Houſes of the Planets, their Characters, and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Signes, before he proceed to any Judgement; to which I leave him, and proceed to the Antiſcions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſcions of the Planets.</p>

As for Example: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Saturn</hi> be in 15 degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in 10 degrees of <hi>Gemini,</hi> they are in Platick Aſpect; for the Orbs of <hi>Saturn</hi> (as you may perceive by the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) are 10 degrees; the half of which is 5 degrees: The Orbs of <hi>Venus</hi> are 8; take half of that, which is 4, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to half the Orbs of <hi>Saturn</hi> makes 9; ſo they are within the Orbs of a <hi>Sextile</hi> Aſpect when they are 9 degrees diſtant from their Partile Aſpect.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Terms of Art that every Student ought well to underſtand.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe firſt is the <hi>Application</hi> of the Planets; which is performed three ways. The firſt is when a light Planet being direct and ſwift in motion, applies to a Planet that is more ponderous and ſlow in motion: As <hi>Mercury</hi> in 8 degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 12 degrees of <hi>Gemini,</hi> and both direct; here <hi>Mercury</hi> applies to a <hi>Sextile</hi> of <hi>Jupiter</hi> by direct application. Secondly, When they are both Retrograde, as <hi>Mercury</hi> in 20 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 15 degrees of <hi>Gemini;</hi> here <hi>Mercury</hi> the lighter Planet applies to the <hi>Sextile</hi> Aſpect of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and this is by Retrogradation.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61484:41"/>Thirdly, When one of the Planets are Direct, and the other Retrograde: as ſuppoſe <hi>Mercury</hi> were Retrograde in 18 degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> Direct in 14 degrees of <hi>Gemini;</hi> here <hi>Mercury</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to a <hi>Sextile</hi> of <hi>Jupiter</hi> by his Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prohibition,</hi> is when two Planets are applying either by Body, or Aſpect, and before they come to their partile Aſpect another Planet meets with the Aſpect of the former, and ſo prohibits it: As <hi>Mars</hi> in 10 degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in 6 degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in 5 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Aries:</hi> here <hi>Venus</hi> is applying to a <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Mars;</hi> but before they come to their partile <hi>Conjunction, Mercury</hi> being more ſwift in motion, comes to a <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> before <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſo prohibits <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Separation</hi> is when two Planets have been lately in <hi>Conjunction</hi> or Aſpect, and are ſeparated from it: As <hi>Saturn</hi> in 10 deg. of <hi>Libra,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in 12 deg. of <hi>Libra;</hi> here <hi>Mercury</hi> is ſeparating from a <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn;</hi> but they are ſtill in platick <hi>Conjunction,</hi> ſo long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main within their Orbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of Light and Vertue, is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61484:42"/>when a lighter Planet ſeparates from the Body or Aſpect of a more weighty one, and immediately applies to another ſuperiour Planet, and ſo tranſlates the light and vertue of the firſt Planet to that which he applies to: As <hi>Mercury</hi> in 8 degrees of <hi>Cancer, Saturn</hi> in 6, and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> in 13; here <hi>Mercury</hi> is ſeparated from a <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and ſo tranſlates the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>tue of <hi>Saturn</hi> to <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hefrenation,</hi> is when a Planet is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the Body or Aſpect of another, and before he comes to it he falls Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, and ſo refrains by his Retrograde motion: As <hi>Saturn</hi> in 10 degrees of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in 7 degrees of <hi>Cancer;</hi> here <hi>Mars</hi> applies to a <hi>Sextile</hi> of <hi>Saturn;</hi> but before he comes to it, he becomes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Combuſtion:</hi> a Planet is ſaid to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt of <hi>Sol,</hi> when he is within 8 degrees 30 minutes of his Body, either before or after their <hi>Conjunction:</hi> but a Planet is more afflicted when he is applying to his Body, than when he is ſeparating from Combuſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reception,</hi> is when two Planets are in each others dignities, and it may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>
                  <hi>Retrograde,</hi> is when a Planet moves backward from 10 degrees to 9, 8, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo contrary to the ſucceſſion of ſignes, out of <hi>Taurus</hi> into <hi>Aries,</hi> and is noted in the Ephemeris thus, ℞.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fruſtration,</hi> is when a ſwift Planet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the Body or Aſpect of a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Planet, and before he comes to it the ſuperiour Planet meets with the Body or Aſpect of ſome other Planet: as <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 15 degrees of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in 10 degrees of the ſame ſigne, and <hi>Mars</hi> in 14 degrees of <hi>Taurus;</hi> here <hi>Venus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to a <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> but before they come to their partile <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, Mars</hi> comes to a <hi>Sextile</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and ſo fruſtrates <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peregrine,</hi> is when a Planet is poſited in a ſigne wherein he hath no Eſſential dignities.</p>

               <p>In the next place, you are to take the places of the reſt of your Planets in the Ephemeris, and place them in the Signes of your Figure; always remembring, if the degrees of the Planets places be leſs than the degrees of the Cuſp of your Houſe, you muſt place him before the Cuſp thereof; but if the degrees be more than the Cuſp of your Houſe, you muſt place him behinde the Cuſp thereof.</p>
               <p>But if you erect a Figure for 8 or 9 hours after noon, the Planets will require a reduction to the hour of the day: for all Ephemerides and Aſtronomical Tables are calculated from Noon to Noon; and ſo you are to reckon the time: as, if you would erect a Figure for two a clock in the Morning, you muſt account it at 14 hours after Noon the day preceding: but if it be onely for a Horary Queſtion, a mental reduction of the Planets places will be ſufficient; onely the Moon, by the ſwiftneſs of her motion, will require a reduction, and by adding 30 minutes to her place for every hour after Noon, and ſubſtracting in the Forenoon 30 minutes for each hour, you may gain her place truely enough for all ordinary Queſtions.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61484:46"/>But for thoſe that deſire more exactneſs, I will give you a Table in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the reducing the Planets places to any hour of the day or night, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to give you an Example of erecting the Figure of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe it were required to erect a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the 6 day of <hi>January,</hi> 1677, at three hours after Noon. In the Ephemeris, I finde the Suns place to be 27 degrees 6 minutes of <hi>Capricorn:</hi> then I look in the Table of Houſes for <hi>Sol</hi> in <hi>Capricorn;</hi> then I guide my eye down the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, (marked at the top <hi>dom. x.</hi> which is the Column of the 10th Houſe) and near the bottom of the Table, I finde 27 degrees; and againſt that in the great Column on the left hand, intituled <hi>Time from Noon,</hi> I finde 19 hours, 56 min. 12 ſec. which I adde to 3 hours, the time of erecting my Figure, and it makes 22 hours 56 minutes 12 ſeconds; which number I ſeek in the Column intituled <hi>Time from Noon,</hi> and the neareſt number to it, is 22 <hi>h.</hi> 57 <hi>m.</hi> 24 <hi>ſ.</hi> Then I look in the column of the 10th Houſe, and I finde 13 degrees, and ♓ at the top for the Cuſp of the 10th houſe; and in the column of the 11th houſe I finde 21 deg. 16 min.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61484:46"/>of ♈; and in the column of the 12th houſe I finde 12 degrees, 31 minutes of ♊, And for the Aſcendent I finde 14 degrees 54 minutes of ♋.

                  <p>How to reduce Planets Motions to any hour of the Day or Night.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN reducing the Planets to any hour of the Day, you are firſt to get their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal motion, by ſubſtracting the places
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61484:48"/>of your Planets the day ſubſequent from the day going before, and the remainder ſhall be the diurnal or daily motion; then work by the rule of Proportion, thus: If 24 hours give ſo many degrees or minutes in a Planets motion, what ſhall your propoſed time give? But to ſave you this labour, I have inſerted the following Table, whereby you may finde the hourly motions of the Planets with more eaſe: but firſt you muſt get the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal motion of the Planets, as you are before directed; and with the diurnal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enter the Table with degrees or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and right againſt it you have their hourly motion; always remembring, that if you enter with degrees, then degrees will anſwer your Queſtion; if you enter with minutes, then minutes will anſwer your Queſtion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if you cannot finde it at once, enter your Table again. Note that D. ſignifies degrees, M. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, S. ſeconds. I will give you one Example from the preceding Scheme, and ſo conclude with the explanation of the Table.</p>

                  <head>A general Rule to know whether a Queſtion be radical, or fit to be judged.</head>
                  <p>Before you give Judgement upon your Figure, you ought carefully to conſider whether your Figure be Radical, or fit for Judgement, leſt the Querent come purpoſely to abuſe you; for the diſcovery of which, the Ancients have left us theſe following Rules.</p>
                  <p>If you finde the Lord of the Aſcendant and Lord of the hour of one and the ſame Triplicity; or when the Lord of the hour, and the ſign aſcending ſhall be of one Triplicity, the Queſtion is then radical, and fit to be judged.</p>
                  <p>When the Signe aſcending, and the Planets poſited in the Aſcendant, or Lord of the Aſcendant, doth exactly deſcribe the Querent, then the Queſtion is fit to be judged, and the Artiſt may boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61484:55"/>
                  <p>The Lord of the Aſcendant in a Signe of the ſame Triplicity of the Lord of the hour; or if the Signe aſcending in a Queſtion be of the ſame Triplicity with the Aſcendant of the Querents Nativity or Revolutional Figure for that year, it ſignifies the Queſtion is radical, and fit to be judged.</p>
                  <p>If you finde the Moles or Marks ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by your Figure do correſpond with the Moles in the Querents body, that is a very good argument that the Figure is fit to be judged.</p>
                  <p>When the beginning of a Signe aſcends upon the Cuſp of the firſt Houſe, or the firſt or ſecond degrees thereof aſcend; or if the latter degrees of a Signe aſcend, <hi>viz.</hi> the 28, 29, or 30th, except the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificators do exactly deſcribe the Querent, and you have the hour of the day very exactly, you are not to give judgement, for it is an argument the matter is forged, or the Querent hath been at others about the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>As the Aſcendant ſignifieth the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſo the 7th houſe and his Lord ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Aſtrologer himſelf: If you finde the Lord of the Aſcendant in <hi>Quadrate</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the Lord of the 7th, have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61484:55"/>a care in giving judgement, leſt the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent come to abuſe you. If the Lord of the ſeventh be Combuſt, or afflicted by the Infortunes or <hi>Dragons Tail,</hi> the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger gets no credit by his Judgement.</p>
                  <p>If you finde the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>via Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi> which is from the laſt 15 deg. of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi> to the firſt 15 deg. of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> it is not ſafe for the Artiſt to paſs Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Alſo the night, <hi>viz.</hi> from Sun-ſetting to Sun-riſing, is divided into twelve parts, making the Planetary hours for the night. For Example: when the days are 14 hours 40 min. long, then the length of the Planetary hour for the day is 90 min, and for the night but 30 min.

                  <hi>An Example of finding the Planetary Hour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe it were required to finde what Planet ruleth on Tueſday the 31 day of <hi>July</hi> 1677, at 3 hours after Noon: I finde his place in the Ephemeris to be 18 deg. 5 minutes of <hi>Leo:</hi> with this 18 deg. I enter the Table, and guide my eye right on, until I come at the Planetary hours after Noon; and in the ſecond Column for the Afternoon, I finde 2 hours 29 min. and at the top of the Table, I finde 8, which ſhews that the 8th Planetary hour ends at 2 hours 29 min. Afternoon. Then in the next Column I finde 3 hours 44 min. which includes the propoſed time; and at the top of the Column I find 9, which ſhews that it is the 9th Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary hour, which hath yet 44 min. to rule. Then I look in the next Table, which ſhews that Planet ruleth every hour of the day; and I ſeek for Wedneſday on the left hand, and the 9th hour at the top of the Table; and in the Angle of meeting I finde <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, which ſhews that ſhe governs that hour. And thus much may ſerve for the Uſe and Explanation of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, I conſidered the Aſcendant, and there I found both the Infortunes, <hi>viz. Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> who are Lords of the Twelfth and Eighth Houſes. Secondly, I conſidered the Lord of the Aſcendant and the <hi>Moon,</hi> who are both poſited in the Seventh; which intimated that the Querent had a great deſire to remove: and finding the <hi>Part of Fortune</hi> in the Tenth, I informed the Querent that it was his beſt way to remove from the houſe he lived in, and that he would profit by his removing. Which advice he followed within a ſhort time, and to this day ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any cauſe to repent it.</p>
                  <p>Old <hi>Saturn</hi> in the Aſcendant, who is both Peregrine and Retrograde, ſhews that the Querent hath ſome ſecret Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies where he lived; and from hence I adviſed the Querent to remove, and from ſome other reaſons, as you may finde in the Figure.</p>

                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:61484:89"/>
                  <p>Or if you finde the Lord of the 5th in the Aſcendant, or the Lord of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant or the <hi>Moon</hi> in the 5th, or in <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> to a benevolent Planet in the 5th, well fortified, and free from the malevolent aſpects of the Infortunes, you may ſafely judge the Querent ſhall have Children.</p>
                  <p>But if on the contrary you finde the ſigne aſcending and the ſigne of the 5th barren ſignes, which are <hi>Leo, Virgo,</hi> and <hi>Gemini,</hi> you may conjecture the Querent will have no Children, except ſome of the other teſtimonies affirmative hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
                  <p>If all the aforeſaid Significators be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in barren ſignes, it denoteth the ſame.</p>
                  <p>If you finde <hi>Saturn, Mars,</hi> or <hi>Dragons tail</hi> in the 5th, eſpecially in barren ſignes, it denies Iſſue.</p>

                  <p>Your beſt and ſafeſt way in judging hereof, is to collect the teſtimonies of Barrenneſs and Fruitfulneſs, and judge

                  <p>If a Woman propound this Queſtion unto you whether ſhe be with Childe or not, you are to give the Aſcendant, his Lord, and the <hi>Moon,</hi> to ſignifie the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and judge according to theſe Rules following.</p>
                  <p>If you finde in your Figure the Lord of the Aſcendant or the <hi>Moon</hi> applying to the Lord of the 5th by <hi>Conjunction, Sextile,</hi> or <hi>Trine,</hi> from good Houſes; or if the <hi>Moon</hi> or Lord of the Aſcendant be found poſited in the 5th Houſe, it is an argument the Querent is with Childe.</p>
                  <p>Or if you finde the Lord of the 5th in the Aſcendant in a fruitful ſigne, no ways afflicted by the Infortunes, it is an argument that the Querent is with Childe.</p>
                  <p>If the Lord of the 5th behold a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in an Angle with Reception, it is an argument the Querent is with Childe:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61484:90"/>and if you finde all the aforeſaid Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators in fruitful ſignes, it may the better confirm your Judgement.</p>
                  <p>If you finde <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who is a natural Significator of Children, poſited in the Aſcendant, 5th, 7th, or 11th Houſes, free from Combuſtion and other afflictions, the Querent is with Childe.</p>
                  <p>But if you finde the aforeſaid Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators afflicted by the malevolent beams of the Infortunes, or by the preſence of <hi>Dragons Tail,</hi> you may judge the Querent is not with Childe.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Doctrine of Nativities,</hi> page 265.

                  <p>Your beſt and ſafeſt way in judging hereof, is to collect the teſtimonies, and judge by the major part, as I ſhall give you an Example hereafter.</p>

                  <p>Some ſhort Rules for the making of Elections upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AN Election, is the chuſing of a fit and proper time for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing promiſed, or for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of any Enterprize. In the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which, we ought to conſider the party's Nativity, if it can poſſibly be obtained: For without it (as Mr. <hi>Coley</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Clavis Aſtrologiae Elimata,</hi> page 276) it is in vain for any perſon to conſtitute an Election; for in an ill Geniture there can no good Election be expected: for if the Houſe from which the Election is required in the perſons Nativity, be infortunated by the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Planets, or the Lord thereof be afflicted, although the Significators of the Figure in the Election be well po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, yet there is little hopes of good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in that Election.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:61484:144"/>
               <p>As for Example: We ſee that two perſons ſetting forward in a long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or Sea-voyage, both at one and the ſame time, and ſo under the ſame face of Heaven; and yet the one hath good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and a happy Journey or Voyage; the other perſon hath an infortunate Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or Voyage, or perhaps dies by the way. This muſt certainly be predicted from their Nativities, and not from the elected time of the undertaking their Voyages. Theſe things being conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I proceed to that which I intend to write of Elections.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of any Enterprize, be ſure you fortifie the <hi>Moon,</hi> and that Planet which was Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; and, if poſſible, let either the <hi>Moon,</hi> or Lord of the Aſcendant, be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in the Aſcendant, in your Figure of Election. That is accounted a good Election, when that Signe aſcends which was poſited in the Cuſp of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in the perſons Nativity; provided it be not infortunated by the preſence of malevolent Planets, or Stars of their nature, or by <hi>Dragons Tail.</hi> If you would elect a time for any thing of long continuance, place a fixed Signe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61484:145"/>the Aſcendant, provided that it was not afflicted in the perſons Nativity, nor upon the Cuſp of the Eighth or Twelfth Houſes: be careful that you place not fixed Stars of a malevolent nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cuſp of that Houſe from which you intend to make your Election.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you make an Election for receiving of Money, or any thing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Second Houſe, fortifie that Planet which was Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in the Nativity, and alſo <hi>Jupiter</hi> who is a natural Significator of Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, if poſſible, let either of them be placed in the Second, or in a good place of the Figure, free from Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion or other afflictions, and in good aſpect to the Fortunes that beheld the Second Houſe, or Lord thereof, by any good aſpect in the Nativity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In all things relating to the Third Houſe, eſpecially for ſhort Journeys, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Aſcendant and his Lord, and the <hi>Moon</hi> and her Diſpoſitor; and alſo the <hi>Part of Fortune,</hi> and the Third Houſe, and the Lord thereof; and let Planets be placed in the Third which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in the Nativity, or in good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Lord of the Third in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61484:145"/>Radix; and be careful that you place not thoſe Planets in the Third which were Lords of the Twelfth, Eighth, or Sixth Houſes in the party's Nativity: Then you ought to conſider what the Journey is intended for, whether to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Money, to ſeek for ſome place of preferment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fortifie that Houſe and Lord thereof which is the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the buſineſs you go about.</p>
               <p>When you make an Election concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning friendſhip between Brethren, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or Neighbours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let the Lord of the Aſcendant in the Nativity be well fortified in the Election; and if you can, let him apply to ſome good Aſpect of the Lord of the Third; or if the Lord of the Aſcendant and Lord of the Third be in Reception and well poſited, it ſhews a good Election.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In Elections belonging to the Fourth Houſe, as concerning the buying or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Houſe, Lands, or Tenements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you are to fortifie that Planet which was Lord of the Fourth in the Geniture, and alſo the Fourth Houſe it ſelf, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Moon,</hi> and let her apply to a good aſpect of the Significators.</p>
               <p>If you conſtitute an Election concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61484:146"/>hidden Treaſure, you ought firſt to view the party's Nativity, and conſider if there be any probability that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſhall be fortunate in finding hidden Treaſure; and if you finde the Lord of the Aſcendant and the Lord of the Fourth well poſited in the Radix, and in good aſpect one to the other, it is an argument the Native will be fortunate in finding hidden Treaſure; and when you intend to ſearch for it, fortifie the Lord of the Aſcendant and the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the Fourth Houſe and Lord thereof, and let them apply to ſome benevolent aſpect; alſo let the Infortunes be cadent, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Planets poſited in Angles.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In Elections appertaining to the Fifth Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you are to fortifie the Lord of the Fifth in the Radix, and, if you can, place the ſigne of the Fifth in the Nativity, upon the Cuſp of the Second in the Election; let <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> behold the Cuſp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or be poſited therein: be careful that the Aſcendant and his Lord be no ways afflicted; and debilitate the Seventh Houſe and his Lord ſo much as you can.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In making Elections for taking of Servants, fortifie the <hi>Moon,</hi> and let her
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61484:146"/>be free from all manner of afflictions, and let the Lord of the Aſcendant, or Lord of the Second in the Radix, be in good aſpect to the Lord of the Sixth; or let the fortunate Planets be poſited in the Sixth, provided they were Lords of good Houſes in the Geniture, or in good aſpect to the Lord of the Aſcendant; and let the <hi>Moon</hi> be poſited in <hi>Taurus, Gemini,</hi> or <hi>Virgo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. In making Elections for Marriages, fortifie the Aſcendant, the Lord thereof, and the <hi>Moon</hi> and her Diſpoſitor; and if you can, let any fixed ſigne aſcend ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Scorpio;</hi> place the <hi>Moon</hi> in a fixed ſigne, and let her be in good aſpect to <hi>Sol;</hi> but beware that the <hi>Moon</hi> be not afflicted by <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> for that ſhews there will be but little love between them. If the <hi>Moon</hi> be in a fruitful ſigne, it is an argument of many Children; but in all Marriages, let the <hi>Moon</hi> be increaſing in light, and free from Combuſtion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In Elections for receiving your Wives Portion, fortifie the Aſcendant and Lord thereof, and let the Lord of the Eighth apply to any good aſpect of the Lord of the Aſcendant, or Lord of the Second; and if they do not behold each
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61484:147"/>other, let them be in mutual Reception. But for ſettling an Eſtate, or making of Wills and Teſtaments that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long, let the <hi>Moon</hi> be increaſing in light, and ſlow in motion, and let the Lord of the Aſcendant and the <hi>Moon</hi> apply to a <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> of <hi>Saturn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. In Elections for taking long Journeys, conſider if the 9th Houſe or Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were not afflicted in the Radix; and let him be well fortified in the Election, and free from the malevolent beams of the Infortunes; and let the Lord of the Ninth be in good aſpect to the Lord of the Aſcendant, or poſited in the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in good aſpect of the Fortunes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In Elections appertaining to the Tenth Houſe, for ſetting up any Trade or Profeſſion, let the Cuſp of the Tenth Houſe in the Nativity be the Aſcendant in the Election; fortifie the Lord of the Aſcendant and the <hi>Moon,</hi> and be careful that they be not afflicted by the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In Elections appertaining to the Eleventh Houſe, in entring into Leagues of Friendſhip, let the Lord of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth in the Radix be well poſited in the Figure of Election, and free from all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61484:147"/>alſo fortifie the <hi>Moon,</hi> let her be ſtrong in her Eſſential dignities, and in good aſpect to the Fortunes.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In Elections for buying Horſes, or great Cattle, let the Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and <hi>Luna,</hi> be free from afflictions, and in ſome of the Eſſential dignities, and in good aſpect to the Lord of the Twelfth in the Radix; alſo let him be fortified and free from afflictions. And ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with Elections: theſe Rules being but rightly underſtood, the ingenious Artiſt may from hence conſtitute an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon any occaſion, and by theſe ſhort Rules finde out a great many more.</p>
